- I’m also interested in data visualization, so right now I’m studying Power BI. Any recommendations on resources for that would be great!

## What i Like!!
- I love learning new things and always enjoy taking on new challenges.
- My favorite animals are rabbits, cats, and dogs!
- I enjoy drawing, photography, cooking, and listening to music.
